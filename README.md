# Smoothie API

This project is built with Rails API.

### Description:
In the spirit of â€˜letting food be our medicine', the Blend app, provides users with healthy smoothie recipes that target different ailments and health concerns. Users will be able to view recipes by category/concern, save their favorite recipes, and submit their own smoothie creations.


### Installing
```
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```


You'll need to run rails server by opening a new terminal tab and running:

```
rails s
```

This api needs the [Blend App](https://github.com/LaKeshiaJohnson/blend)in order for it to run. Please visit the Blend repo for instructions on how to run the Blend app on your machine.
